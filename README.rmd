Zooarchaeology is concerned with the analysis and inference of faunal remains recovered from archaeological sites. The **zooaRchGUI package** provides a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* to analytical tools for zooarchaeological data in the R package. Functions in this package allow users to:

* input 
* handle 
* visualize 
* and analyze zooarchaeological data

Useful data are available with the package. After installing and starting zooaRchGUI, users will have access to these data. Most datasets are in ["wide format"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data). Included is Binford's comprehensive forager dataset (Binford 2001) made available by Dr. Amber Johnson from http://ajohnson.sites.truman.edu/data-and-program/. Typing "?LRBdata" into the R (or RStudio) console provides information about the dataset. The key to this dataset is also available and provides users with descriptions of the variable names. The Binford dataset can be used as example for most functions in zooaRchGUI.

## Part 1 **Installing zooaRchGUI**

#### Install R and RStudio
1.	Install R by downloading the latest version from the Cromprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) https://www.r-project.org/. 
2.	To make coding easier, you might also want to download RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop.

#### Install the *zooaRchGUI* package
1.	Prior to installing the zooaRchGUI package, please make sure you have the following programs installed in your Apple/Windows/Linux machines:
    a.	Apple Macintosh machines NEED to have XQuartz installed, download from	https://www.xquartz.org/ 
    b.  Please download and install "JAGS", necessary for Bayesian computations, for your particular operating system from the download section in http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/
2.	Now that you have these installed, start up R or RStudio.
3.  There are several ways to install the latest version of zooaRchGUI:
    
    a. Directly from CRAN: 
    ```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE} 
    install.packages("zooaRchGUI", dependencies=TRUE)
    ``` 
    b. or from github (installing devtools), where versions with latest patches can be found:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE} 
    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("zooarchGUI/zooaRchGUI", dependencies=TRUE)
    ``` 
4.	You can install the following necessary packages by copying and pasting the following R code into the RStudio console
    ```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
    install.packages(c("ggplot2","tcltk2", "tkrplot", "car", "readxl","foreign",
                   "maptools","spdep","raster", "tripack", "pgirmess", "geomorph", 
                   "vegan", "splancs", "rjags", dependencies = TRUE))
    ```
5.	You can also install these packages interactively by typing the names of the packages into RStudio. Get this R-studio dropdown through tools->Install Packages. Make sure "installed dependencies" is checked
![](figs/8_Install%20packages%20from%20RStudio.png)

6.	Once the package is installed [DONE (zooaRchGUI)], you can load zooaRchGUI by sending the following commands to the R-studio console:
```{r, eval=F,echo=T}

library(zooaRchGUI)
```

Start up *zooaRchGUI* by typing
```{r, eval=F,echo=T}
zooaRch_GUI()
```
into the RStudio console. Then, the GUI should appear  
![](figs/10_zooaRch%20GUI%20appears.png)

 
That's it! You can browse through the package, import your own data, or use the included datasets in the package. Type the command: help(package = "zooaRchGUI") into the console):
